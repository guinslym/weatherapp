dev journal:  
>this app displays fundmental functionality of how to load and present json data called from an api.  
>also using react-router allows for different routes to be displayed and have a seamless ui/ux.  
>there are a few things that could be updated, for example using browserHistory vs hashHistory for cleaner routes.  
>however, the main functionality is present and building this app helped reinforce certain concepts of react.
